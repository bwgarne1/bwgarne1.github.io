                <p>
                    Theatre Etiquette, or, as I like to call it, "Theatrequette" is a very important aspect of attending a show at
                    a theatre. You want to always remain respectful to both the performers on stage and the audience around you,
                    and also respect the venue itself. Watch the following video to get some quick tips on do's and dont's when
                    attending a production, then read the information below to make your night out at the theatre a success
                    without embarassment!
                </p>

                <h3>Dress to Impress!</h3>

                <p>
                    Dressing for the theatre can be a daunting task. While there is usually no formal dress code for attending
                    a theatre performance, be mindful that you dress appropriately. Clothing should be clean, presentable, and
                    it's best to avoid clothing that might contain phrasing that could be found offensive by other patrons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The majority of people who attend a theatre performance will likely be dressed at least business casual if not
                    more. This means a polo or nicer button down shirt and either jeans or slacks for men, and a wide variety of
                    dress for women from a nice blouse and slacks to a dress or jacket depending on weather. If you're unable to
                    acquire more dressy clothing, don't let that stop you from attending a performance! All patrons are welcome.
                </p>

                <h3>Respect the Audience</h3>

                <p>
                    It is important, when attending a theatrical performance, to remember that you are also attending it along
                    with hundreds of other patrons. This means that you should take care to not cause disruptions to other members
                    of the audience. Some of the major things to avoid are the following:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensure your phone is off. Silenced phones can still make noise when vibrating which can be annoying to
                        those around you
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arrive on time! Many theatres will not let you into the performance until a break if you arrive late, but
                        if they do you will disturb other audience members by walking over them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only leave during intermission. Try your best not to go out during the performance as this will cause
                        other people to miss a part of the performance as you walk over them. Make sure you arrive back to your
                        seat on time if you leave during intermission!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No talking! Talking to your companions will annoy other patrons around you who came to see the performance
                        not listen to you!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Respect the Performers</h3>

                <p>
                    It's very important to respect the performers that are up on stage for your entertainment. These performers
                    likely perform six to seven times a week and deserve to be paid attention to! Some of the best ways to show
                    that you respect the performs are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don't take pictures of or record the performance. Not only is it illegal, but flashes from cameras or videos
                        can also be very dangerous to the performers on stage. Also, you're there to watch the performance, not
                        to record it!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clap at appropriate times. The most appropriate time to clap is generally after a song has ended. Make sure
                        that the song is actually over before you begin clapping, as often movements in the music can cause
                        premature clapping. Always feel free to clap at an exceptional joke or choreographical moment!
                    </li>
                </ul>
