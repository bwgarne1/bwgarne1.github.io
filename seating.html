        <h2>Seating Tips</h2>

        <p>
            Where you sit in a theatre has a huge impact on the overall experience of the performance. While most of the time you
            will be able to hear everything no matter your seat location, different seat locations offer different viewing
            experiences and some are objectively superior to others. The following information aims to help you decide where
            the best location is for you!
        </p>

        <h3>Orchestra</h3>

        <p>
            The Orchestra is the first tier of seating, usually consisting of all of the seats on the ground. These seats
            are generally the best and most expensive.
        </p>

            <tr>
                <th>Tier</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Center Orchestra</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are the best of the best. Located in the middle of the theater on the lowest level, these
                    seats usually provide a great, centered, up-close view of the performers and their costumes.
                </td>
                <td>$$$$$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Left/Right Orchestra</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are generally very good. Located on the sides of the Center Orchestra on the lowest level
                    of the theater, these seats still provide a great, up-close view of the performance, though some details
                    can get hidden or missed due to the viewing angle, especially if located on the extreme right or left of
                    this section.
                </td>
                <td>$$$$</td>

                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are usually located underneath the overhang of the Mezzanine section. As such, they can
                    occasionally result in a partial view of some stage effects. These seats are the farthest away from the stage
                    on the lower level of the theatre, and are usually considered worse than premium Mezzanine seats.

                <td>$$$</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Mezzanine</h3>

        <p>
            The Mezzanine is a raised level that usually extends over the back third of the Orchestra. The first several rows
            of the Mezzanine are often of similar quality and price to Orchestra and offer a higher view of the production.
        </p>

        <table id="mezzanineTable">
            <tr>
                <th>Tier</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Price Level</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Center Mezzanine</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These are fantastic seats in the center of the first raised level in the theatre. The first several rows
                    of this section are often the same horizontal distance from the stage as many Center Orchestra seats.
                    These seats offer a great view of the whole production and give a solid view of the overall
                    production. These seats are generally still close enough to see all facial expressions and choreography.
                    Many prefer the first rows of the Mezzanine over Orchestra seats.

            <tr>
                <td>Left/Right Mezzanine</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are located to the sides of the Center Mezzanine and usually give good views of the overall
                    production. Some sightlines may not be the best, though facial details and costuming can usually still
                    be seen well from these seats.

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rear Mezzanine</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are located in the back of the first raised level. If the theatre has a balcony, these seats
                    are generally located beneath the balcony overhang, which can lead to a partial view of some stage effects.
                    These seats may be considered worse than the best balcony seats.
                </td>
                <td>$$</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Balcony</h3>

        <p>
            Some theatres have another raised level above the Mezzanine level. Not all theaters have this section, and it
            is not commonly found in most Broadway theatres. These seats are usually the highest and farthest away from
            the stage; thus they are generally the lowest quality viewing experience and lowest price.

                <th>Tier</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Front Balcony</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are in the front of the second raised level. They are often quite high and far away
                    from the stage, but can still provide a good view of the overall production. Many facial and costume
                    details will be difficult to see at this range.

                <td>$$</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Rear Balcony</td>
                <td class="text-left">
                    These seats are the very highest and farthest seats from the stage in the theatre. Stage details will
                    be difficult to clearly make out at this range, though sound is usually still stellar. These are generally the most
                    affordable tickets in the theatre. Stage effects that take place on raised platforms, catwalks, or aerial
                    choreography may be hidden at this level.
