                                            I was absolutely blown away by this show! I had doubts going into it because I
                                            had no frame of reference for the material - but wow! What a hilarious show; I don't
                                            think I stopped laughing except maybe during intermission! I would highly recommend.
                                            One tip - don't sit in the front row of the balcony! The lighting equipment
                                            causes there to be less leg room in this location!

                                            Phantom is such a classic show that I knew I would love this. I was in the third row
                                            and I could see everything! The talent on display during this show is so inspiring -
                                            especially because the show has been running for so long. It's so impressive
                                            that they still put 110% into it! It's been running for 30 years for a reason:
                                            spectacular!

                                            This show surprised me. I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into when
                                            I showed up here, but what I found was an absolutely heartwarming story of
                                            acceptance and loving who you are and who you can be. With absolutely irresistibly
                                            catchy songs and an incredible message of tolerance, I walked out of this show
                                            with a feeling of happiness it's hard to describe. Absolutely a must-see!
