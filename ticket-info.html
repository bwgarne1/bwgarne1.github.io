        <h2>Ticket Information</h2>

        <p>
            There are so many ways to get tickets to musical performances that it can be difficult to decide the best way
            to do so! Also, it can be difficult to make sure that tickets that you're purchasing are valid and not
            counterfeit. The worst possible outcome would be for you to spend money and time to go to a show and realizing
            the tickets that you bought are not valid! On this page you'll learn the best ways to find tickets as well as
            some strategies for discount and cheaper tickets.
        </p>

        <h3>Box Office</h3>

        <p>
            The best way to ensure a valid ticket with a minimum of fees is to purchase the ticket in person directly from
            the box office. These are not always the best priced tickets, but you can be sure that the ticket is valid. The
            box office is generally located in the lobby of the theatre where the performance will take place.
        </p>

        <h3>Online Vendor</h3>

        <img src="resources/ticketmaster.png" width="100" height="100">
        <img src="resources/telecharge.jpg" width="100" height="100">

        <p>
            Nearly all performances, whether a Broadway, Broadway Tour, or Community Theatre performance, will allow online
            ticket purchases. The two vendors most often used for these purchases are Ticketmaster and Telecharge. Telecharge
            is favored by many of the theatres on Broadway in New York, while Ticketmaster is the most common for tour
            venues. Community theatres will sometimes use Ticketmaster, but they are more likely to use less advanced systems
            or their own systems. Online vendors will usually guarantee verified tickets as they are directly through the
            venue, so you can be confident that you are receiving a valid ticket.
        </p>

        <h3>Third Party Services</h3>

        <img src="resources/stubhub.png" width="100" height="100">
        <img src="resources/tickpick.png" width="100" height="100">
        <img src="resources/cheaptickets.jpg" width="100" height="100">
        <img src="resources/ebay.png" width="100" height="100">

        <p>
            Purchasing tickets from third party services is always a risk, as you cannot be sure that the tickets that you
            are purchasing are legit. Some of the more reputable third party sellers, such as StubHub, will guarantee your
            ticket, but this can mean hassle at the time of the performance when you realize that your ticket is not valid.
            Also, it is possible that a comparable ticket will be unable to be secured, and, even though you may receive a
            refund, you won't get to see the performance!
        </p>

        <p>
            Purchasing tickets directly from others through services such as eBay or Craiglist, or from a ticket scalper
            on the street is not recommended. These services often come with on guarantee that your tickets are valid and
            you may be completely out of luck if the tickets you purchased turn out to be fake.
        </p>

        <h2>Discounts and Deals</h2>

        <p>
            While rare, it IS possible to get cheaper tickets than face value if you know where to look and with a little
            bit of luck.
        </p>

        <h3>Student Discounts</h3>

        <p>
            Many venues offer cheaper tickets if you can show a student ID. Sometimes these tickets can be up to half face
            value! These types of discounts usually come with restrictions, the most common of which are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>One student priced ticket per valid ID</li>
            <li>Student discount only offered at Box Office, no online ticketing</li>
            <li>No student discounts for premier seating</li>
            <li>Student discount only offered on the day of the performance for unsold tickets</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While they can have several annoying stipulations, student priced tickets are still a fantastic way to see a
            show for less and bring theatre performance access to students who are limited on funds.
        </p>

        <h3>Lotteries</h3>

        <p>
            Many shows, especially in NYC, will offer a ticket lottery on the day of the show. These lotteries are usually
            for a set number of center orchestra tickets, generally in the first several rows of the Orchestra. These
            lottery tickets are usually heavily discounted, with a price ranging from ten to twenty dollars. Many theatres
            have moved to online lotteries, where you enter for one or two tickets per person online on the day of the show
            and receive access to purchase the discounted tickets before the show if you are selected in the lottery. Some
            general stipulations usually apply to lotteries:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lottery tickets are valid on the day of the lottery only</li>
            <li>Lottery tickets must be purchased within a certain timeframe (usually 1-2 hours) of notification of
            lottery win, or tickets are forfeit</li>
            <li>One lottery entry per person</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Trying your luck at the lottery is great for those who live close to a venue and would have no problem getting
            to the performance within a few hours of being notified of a lottery win. Lotteries are usually held for the
            most popular shows that are likely to be sold out, so they are a great way to get into a show that you wouldn't
            have a chance to before.
        </p>

        <h3>New York City: TKTS Booth</h3>

        <p>
            For those located in New York City, many Broadway theatres will send any unsold tickets on the day of the
            performance to the TKTS booths scattered throughout the city. The most popular TKTS booth is in Times Square,
            but all of the booths get a different allotment of tickets to different shows. These tickets tend to be heavily
            discounted and are often sold for 25-50% off face value. The locations of the seats are random and the shows
            available change every day, but for diehard theatre fans in the area visiting a TKTS booth can result in a
            great deal to a great performance. It is unlikely that the hottest, newer shows will show up at TKTS booths,
            but it has been known to happen.
