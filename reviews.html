                <p>
                    "A phenomenal production effortlessly led by the lead, Christine Dwyer, who plays Jenna with  a gentle
                    presence that shows remarkable strength as she slowly grows throughout the show. This show had me
                    from the very first moments. I often found myself laughing uncontrollably only to be thrust back into
                    serious contemplation as we moved from lighthearted themes like Dawn's struggle to find a boyfriend
                    who embraces her quirks to the clearly abusive relationship between Jenna and her husband. This show
                    is a simple story of a woman looking to find a better life while embracing the best parts of her current one,
                    and it truly shows you "What Baking Can Do"! Highly recommended."

                    Phantom is such a classic show that I knew I would love this. I was in the third row
                    and I could see everything! The talent on display during this show is so inspiring -
                    especially because the show has been running for so long. It's so impressive
                    that they still put 110% into it! It's been running for 30 years for a reason:
                    spectacular!

                <p>
                    It was such a pleasure to be in "The Room Where it Happens" and seeing this incredible show come to
                    life. One of the oft overlooked parts of this show is how entrancing the choreography is. I often
                    found myself paying more attention to the incredible choregraphy going on in the background than to
                    the songs I already know so well. This cast did a fantastic job, and I was not at all disappointed
                    even though I have listened to the original Broadway recording hundreds of times. The real strength
                    of Hamilton shines through Lin Manuel Miranda's storytelling, that brings alive even the most boring
                    of historical events into something fascinating for all.

                <p>
                    Ah, Wicked! I've always had a soft spot in my heart for this show, and I've seen it several times. This
                    performance at ASU Gammage was one of the best that I've seen. Alyssa Fox as Elphaba truly soars as
                    she belts to the rafters only to come down and make even the softer parts come alive. And who could
                    forget Carrie St. Louis as G(a)linda, who you truly despise at the beginning only to fall in love with
                    as the show goes on. It's telling that the real standout song from this show isn't "Defying Gravity"
                    or the soaring love ballad "As Long as You're Mine", but the late Act 2 duet "For Good". This show
                    truly is about the true love of two best friends. Lovely. It's no wonder this show does so well
                    that it stays for six weeks at a time!

                <p>
                    I was absolutely blown away by this show! I had doubts going into it because I
                    had no frame of reference for the material - but wow! What a hilarious show; I don't
                    think I stopped laughing except maybe during intermission! I would highly recommend.
                    One tip - don't sit in the front row of the balcony! The lighting equipment
                    causes there to be less leg room in this location! Note that this show is EXTREMELY politically
                    incorrect and is definitely not recommended for younger people - or the easily offended!

                <p>
                    This show surprised me. I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into when
                    I showed up here, but what I found was an absolutely heartwarming story of
                    acceptance and loving who you are and who you can be. With absolutely irresistibly
                    catchy songs and an incredible message of tolerance, I walked out of this show
                    with a feeling of happiness it's hard to describe. Absolutely a must-see!
