                <p>
                    Not all musical performances are created equal! The professional quality of the performers, size of the budget,
                    and overall spectacle of the show often differs depending on where you are viewing the performance and what
                    company is putting on the production. The same show can be remarkably different between different tiers of
                    performances. The following information is meant to allow you to compare and contrast the different performance
                    options and find the one that most interests you and fits your ability to attend!

                <h3>Broadway Performances</h3>

                <p>
                    Broadway Theatres are located in New York City, New York in what is commonly called the Theatre District, which is
                    mainly 42nd Street near Times Square. There are currently 41 theatres with this designation. Performances within
                    these theatres is widely considered to represent the highest level of commerical theatre available in the English
                    speaking world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Broadway performances contain the highest level of professional performer, who are usually professionally trained
                    and come out of the best theatre programs in the country. Often, lead performers are well known within the community
                    and replacements for lead roles often cast well known movie or television actors to generate publicity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shows on Broadway often open with what is called an "open run", which means that they do not have a defined end
                    date. Some shows, like Wicked or The Phantom of the Opera, have run for over a decade in the same location. Shows
                    close, or end, if they are deemed to no longer be profitable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Broadway performances are generally the most expensive musical performances one can attend. Tickets for the hottest
                    shows in the best seats often soar over five hundred dollars and have been known to break a thousand dollars per
                    seat for the most in demand shows.
                </p>

                <h3>Broadway Tour Performances</h3>

                <p>
                    A Broadway tour is a touring version of a Broadway performance. Often, the show will continue running on Broadway
                    while its touring cast travels across the country to different venues. Sometimes, a show will continue touring
                    even if it has closed on Broadway or not start touring until after the show closes on Broadway.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These productions can generally be expected to be comprised of the same level of performer quality as in
                    their Broadway counterparts, and touring casts often contain cast members that have also performed in the
                    Broadway production. This is a great asset to the local venues that the tours visit, as it allows people who
                    are unwilling or unable to travel to New York to still experience a Broadway-caliber performance. The one
                    concession that touring shows often make is the extravagance of the sets, as they must be able to move them
                    across the country and place them in a variety of theatre setups. They are still usually extremely close to
                    their Broadway counterparts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hottest shows touring the country often only stay in one city for one week, though older, popular shows
                    or shows with multiple tours going on at once sometimes stay for up to a month in one location. They often
                    perform eight shows - six night shows and two matinees on the weekend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tickets to a Broadway tour are often still quite expensive, though usually much cheaper than a comparable ticket
                    on Broadway. The best seats often still reach into the hundreds, but often cheaper seats can be found starting
                    as low as $20. These performances are a great choice for those who wish to see a Broadway performance at a
                    lower ticket and travel cost.
                </p>

                <h3>Community Theatre Performances</h3>

                <p>
                    Community Theatres vary wildly in show selection and are definitely a mixed bag. They are often run as non-profit
                    organizations within the community that they serve, and are staffed by local talent. The shows put on by community
                    theatres range from older Broadway shows which are no longer running to original productions or smaller shows
                    that never made it to Broadway. Usually, a show that is still currently running on Broadway is not available for
                    community theatres to perform due to licensing rights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The performance quality of a community theatre production can vary wildly depending on budget, performer quality,
                    and directorial team quality. Some of the best community theatre productions can rival a Broadway production,
                    and are fantastic opportunities for performers in the community to get a chance to perform in front of an audience.
                    Community theatre performers are often unpaid or volunteers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The length of a production in a community theatre can vary greatly from theatre to theatre and from performance
                    to performance. Many productions may only perform three shows, while some productions will run for weeks. It is
                    common to see community theatre productions run shows for several weekends in a row, with no shows during the
                    week due to production costs and community interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tickets to a community theatre production are often the cheapest tickets you'll find to a musical performance.
                    It is rare to see community theatre prices any higher than a hundred dollars, and many performances can be had
                    for less than twenty dollars. This makes them a fantastic option for younger theatre fans and those who would
                    not usually be able to attend musical performances.
